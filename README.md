# jlox and clox

This repository will be my following, and hopeful deviation, from the Lox interpreter as introduced in Robert Nystrom's [Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com/).

His book is phenomenal, and aside from following a compiler course in university, and understanding most of the concepts somewhat well, I've never actually built a compiler, so I thought it would be a good exercise, even if the support wheels are tightly fastened on.
